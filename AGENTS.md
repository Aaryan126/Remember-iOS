# AGENTS.md

This file defines the working rules for every coding agent operating in this repository. Follow these instructions for all files and subdirectories unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` exists deeper in the tree.

## Absolute Git Safety Rule

Never change Git state in this repository.

- Never run `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or any equivalent command.
- Never stage, commit, push, fetch, pull, merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, tag, stash, switch, checkout, reset, restore, clean, or modify branches, remotes, hooks, configuration, the index, refs, or history.
- Never create a repository, initialize a worktree, force-push, or open/update a pull request.
- Never use a Git library, IDE integration, hosting API, or other tool to perform an action that would be forbidden at the command line.
- Do not modify anything inside `.git/`.
- Read-only inspection such as `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, and `git show` is allowed only when useful, but it must not change repository state.
- Leave all version-control actions to the user. When work is complete, report the files changed and the checks run; do not prepare or publish a commit.

This rule is unconditional. A task is not complete if it requires violating it; instead, explain that the user must perform the Git step themselves.

## Core Working Principles

- Understand the relevant code, configuration, tests, and documentation before editing.
- Make the smallest coherent change that fully solves the request.
- Preserve existing behavior and public interfaces unless the task explicitly requires a breaking change.
- Follow the repository's established architecture, naming, formatting, and dependency patterns.
- Prefer clear, maintainable code over clever abstractions or premature optimization.
- Keep unrelated refactors, formatting churn, and generated-file changes out of the task.
- Preserve user changes. Never overwrite, delete, or undo work that is outside the requested scope.
- State assumptions when requirements are ambiguous, and ask before making a choice with significant product, data, security, or compatibility impact.

## Before Editing

1. Read the nearest applicable `AGENTS.md` and relevant project documentation.
2. Inspect the files involved and search for related implementations, tests, types, and call sites.
3. Identify existing build, lint, format, test, and type-check commands from project configuration.
4. Check for local modifications using non-mutating inspection when useful, and avoid disturbing them.
5. Plan for compatibility, validation, error handling, security, accessibility, and tests appropriate to the change.

## Implementation Standards

- Use descriptive names and small, focused functions and modules.
- Keep business logic separate from transport, UI, persistence, and framework glue when practical.
- Avoid duplicated logic; reuse a local abstraction when it is genuinely shared and stable.
- Prefer explicit data flow and dependency injection over hidden global state.
- Use strong types and narrow interfaces where the language supports them. Avoid untyped escape hatches unless unavoidable and documented.
- Validate data at trust boundaries, including user input, network responses, files, environment variables, and database records.
- Handle expected failures deliberately. Do not swallow exceptions or return misleading success states.
- Make operations idempotent when they may be retried.
- Consider concurrency, cancellation, timeouts, resource cleanup, and partial failure for I/O or asynchronous work.
- Use structured logging where available. Log actionable context, but never secrets or unnecessary personal data.
- Comment why a non-obvious decision exists, not what straightforward code already says.
- Remove dead code, debugging statements, placeholder hacks, and commented-out implementations introduced during the task.
- Do not hand-edit generated artifacts unless the project explicitly treats them as source files.

## Security and Privacy

- Never hard-code, print, expose, or commit secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or sensitive user data.
- Store local secrets in ignored environment files or the project's approved secret manager.
- Provide sanitized examples through files such as `.env.example`; use placeholders, never real values.
- Apply least privilege to permissions, credentials, network access, and data access.
- Use parameterized queries and safe framework APIs. Prevent injection, path traversal, unsafe deserialization, SSRF, XSS, CSRF, and authorization bypasses as relevant.
- Authenticate and authorize on trusted server-side boundaries; never rely solely on client-side checks.
- Avoid adding dependencies for functionality that can be implemented safely and simply with existing tools.
- If a dependency is necessary, prefer maintained, reputable packages and keep the project's lockfile updated through its package manager.
- Do not weaken security controls, certificate validation, type checks, lint rules, or tests merely to make a change pass.

## Testing and Verification

- Scale verification to the change as described below. Add or update tests for meaningful behavior, important branches, and regressions when a test framework exists; routine cosmetic edits do not require new automated tests.
- Prefer deterministic tests that do not depend on real external services, wall-clock timing, random state, or execution order.
- Test observable behavior rather than private implementation details.
- Include edge cases and failure paths, not only the happy path.
- Run the narrowest relevant checks first. Broaden or repeat them only when changed code, a failure, an explicit requirement, or an unresolved risk justifies it; do not automatically run every available suite.
- Do not claim a check passed unless it was actually run successfully.
- If a check cannot run, report the exact command, failure, and likely reason. Do not hide failures or disable checks.
- Never change production behavior solely to accommodate a weak test; improve the test or design instead.

## Proportionate Work for Small Fixes

- The user prefers quick, focused implementation for small UI fixes. Default to inspecting the affected code, making the smallest coherent edit, and running the relevant build or focused check. Once sufficient checks pass, finish.
- For cosmetic changes such as text, color, spinner size, spacing, or a simple animation adjustment, do not automatically add test infrastructure, run broad regressions, record videos, or create evaluation reports, deployment wrappers, source-hash archives, or checkpoint systems.
- Navigation or gesture changes may need focused Back, swipe-back, and cancellation checks. Broader testing is appropriate when search logic, persistence, migrations, security, or other substantial behavior changes; choose checks based on the affected behavior.
- Reuse existing build caches and deployment tooling. Do not repeat successful source-matched checks merely because the user subsequently requests installation.
- Install on the user's phone when requested, using an in-place update that preserves app data. Do not uninstall or reset the app. Keep applicable data-protection and resource safeguards, but do not introduce a new full backup/comparison pipeline for each cosmetic fix without a concrete need or explicit requirement.
- Respect requests to skip phone testing. Installing and opening an authorized update does not imply that a full physical-device test suite is needed.
- If a mandatory safeguard or a newly discovered issue will add substantial work, briefly explain the specific reason upfront. Do not silently expand a small fix into a large verification project or ask for redundant approval.
- Keep the handoff short: what changed, which checks actually ran, and installation status when relevant. Update documentation only where needed for lasting behavior or setup guidance; small visual changes do not need standalone reports.

## Frontend and UX

- Use semantic HTML and accessible controls with keyboard support, visible focus states, labels, and appropriate ARIA only when native semantics are insufficient.
- Maintain responsive behavior across common viewport sizes.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences, adequate contrast, and existing design tokens/components.
- Represent loading, empty, error, success, disabled, and partial-data states where applicable.
- Avoid unnecessary client work, layout shifts, oversized assets, and inaccessible custom widgets.

## APIs, Data, and Migrations

- Keep APIs backward compatible unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.
- Use consistent schemas, status codes, error shapes, pagination, and validation.
- Treat database migrations as production-sensitive: make them reversible when practical, safe for existing data, and compatible with staged deployments.
- Avoid destructive data operations without explicit user authorization and a verified recovery plan.
- Do not silently change data formats, identifiers, time-zone behavior, or numeric precision.

## Dependencies and Generated Files

- Use the package manager and lockfile already selected by the project; do not introduce a second package manager.
- Do not delete, replace, or regenerate a lockfile casually.
- Keep dependency additions minimal and explain any non-obvious choice.
- Do not modify vendored code, build output, coverage output, caches, or generated files unless the task specifically requires it.
- Keep machine-specific configuration and secrets out of source files.

## Documentation

- Update relevant README, API, configuration, migration, or operational documentation when behavior or setup changes.
- Keep examples runnable and consistent with the code.
- Document new environment variables in `.env.example` or the project's established configuration reference.
- Record meaningful compatibility concerns, limitations, and migration steps.

## Final Handoff

At the end of a task:

- Summarize what changed and why.
- List the validation commands actually run and their results.
- Call out unresolved risks, assumptions, or checks that could not be completed.
- Identify any manual steps the user must perform.
- Do not stage, commit, push, or otherwise publish the work.
