Citation: “Efficient Intent Detection with Dual Sentence Encoders,” NLP for ConvAI 2020. `Organization/public/` contains a deterministic 200-example subset of the original test data (20 intents, ten examples each). Source text and intent labels are unchanged; opaque IDs and the Remember input/label schema were added. This diagnostic is not an official full BANKING77 score. The pinned revision, original row indices, selection rule, and source SHA256 are recorded in [provenance.json](Organization/public/provenance.json).
